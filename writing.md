#It's Time#
It’s time.  

Time to tell you the secret I’ve been keeping from you for over a year. Some of you connected the dots and figured it out. Others, I confided what’s going on. Regardless, it’s time to share what has beat me down, kicked me in the gut, and forced me to completely rearrange and reevaluate my life.

If you told me 15 months ago, this is what my life would look like, I wouldn’t have believed you. But today I’ve accepted what’s happened (and happening) to me and moved to a place of accepting what my “new normal” is. It has not been easy. I’ve felt the gamut of emotions from a crushing sadness that brought me to my knees, crying deeply to smiling from the depths of my heart and soul.

But this is still hard to share with all of you. I feel shame and fear at times and those are tough emotions to stare in the face. Yet there is also great power in sharing my secrets as they move from inside my head and out into the world.

Out of my heart and into yours.

####The Facts####
In December 2011 I lost my job. My third layoff in three years. Four weeks later, my wife and I decided to separate after nearly ten years of marriage. I moved out of my house and moved in with my parents. I moved away from my two beautiful, courageous and inspiring children (aged 8 and 5 today).

The reason for our separation and subsequent divorce is over a period of 3-4 years, we evolved from being a husband and wife into friends and roommates. The romantic connection was gone and it was not coming back. So rather than stay in a loveless marriage for another 30-40 years, it was time to admit the truth and begin the process of moving on.

We both weren’t getting what we wanted out of the marriage and longed for something we knew we couldn’t give each other. It was a mutual decision and one that had been discussed openly for years. I deserve to have the love and connection I want and realizing I wasn’t going to get it in my marriage was a big hurdle to clear. We’ve remained friends to this day and I hope for our children's sake it stays that way. The legal process of my divorce has begun and will be over soon.

_**UPDATE**_: As of July 11, 2013 at 10:19 AM, the divorce is final.

Those are the facts. The truth. The story I’ve hidden from you. There’s so much more to my story, but first you need the facts.

####Why Now####
So why am I sharing this now? Why have I kept you in the dark? In short, I’m ready to move on. When this all began last year, fear of what other people would think and the shame of a failed marriage kept the truth concealed from the world. 

But I’ve discovered recently the power in sharing my story and opening up the opportunity for connection. And for me to move past this, I can’t hide the truth any longer. I’m ready to begin the next chapter in my story.  

It’s time.

####Shame and Questions####
While I’m very proud of the man I’ve become in the past 15 months, it comes with a feeling of shame that I had to wait until my marriage was over and I was unemployed for this growth to happen.  

Why did it all have to happen this way?  
Why did I have to put my children through this?  
Why did I have to put myself through this?  
What’s wrong with me?  
Will I ever find love again?  
Will I ever be happy?  

These questions and more like it yank me down so far into the gooey swamp where the tiniest shred of hope can’t be found. Before, I would willingly let the swamp take me in. Keep me hostage for a long time. But now, I choose not to give voice to those questions because I know where that will lead me. It leads to shame, fear, apathy, pity and relinquishing of control.

I’ve come too far in my journey to give up now. Instead, I view this moment as being given a second chance to make my life the way I want it. And I don’t intend to waste that chance. I intend to make the most of it. We’re not given many second chances in this life and being 34 years old, I still have lots of living left to do.

Not only for myself, but also for my kids. What kind of role model would I be to them if I just gave in to the negative shit that’s come my way? What message would that send to give up when life got hard? Yes I’ve been beaten down, yes I’ve been broken, but that doesn’t mean I can’t pick myself back up and rise out of the ashes of what’s happened to me.

####Change in Perspective####
The end of my marriage will affect my children, but not as much as seeing their Dad stay in a loveless marriage. As much as seeing him remain in a place because he “should” regardless of his desire for something more. Choosing to walk away from my marriage will have a greater benefit to my children than staying put. When they’re old enough, it can become a teaching point that it’s ok to walk away from something that isn’t working for you anymore. There is power and courage in standing up for yourself and what you believe in and what you want out of your life.

Through this all I’ve come to view my children in a different light. My time spent with them is precious and I maximize it by putting away the phone and distractions and simply being with them. That’s all they want. They just want someone to be with them, play with them and see them for who they are. It’s as simple as that. All the credit in the world goes to Rachel Stafford at [Hands Free Mama](http://handsfreemama.com/) for this massive change in perspective. 

Not only has this change deepened my connection to my kids, but it helped me reframe not seeing my kids from a place of lacking to a place of opportunity. Yes the time I see my kids has massively reduced, but now I’m able to squeeze every ounce of the precious time with them into an opportunity for connection.

####My Foundation####
I’ve been asked a lot about how I’m able to handle the divorce and being away from my kids so well. I credit years of therapy and self development for creating a solid foundation within myself. So when the tornado of divorce and moving away from my kids hit, my house had a solid foundation to rely on.  

Yes this house shook.  
Yes it was scary.  
Yes things I held dear fell off the walls and broke.  
Yes it felt like the whole house would come crashing down and kill me.  
But it didn’t. I’m still standing.  
I’m still here talking to you about what I’ve gone through. And I’m relying on my solid foundation as I begin to build a new house.

####Connection####
In the 15 months since I’ve become separated and moved out of my house I’ve deepened my writing skills, become a poet, reduced my marathon time by 45 minutes, ran a 50 mile ultramarathon, ran a 31 mile ultramarathon, completed the GoRuck Challenge, and developed a meditation practice. And while those are all great, the aspect I’m most proud of is the connecting I’ve done with more people than I can count. 

It’s significant because for most of the time I was married I hid behind my wife and kids. My choices revolved around how my decisions would affect their happiness. Now having that option removed, I was left all alone. At first this loneliness ate me up. But little by little, I began connecting with people I would have never imagined. People who came into my life at precisely the right time and for just the right reasons to make an impact on me. There is no way I would have met them had I remained in my marriage.

Gratitude for each and every one of them doesn’t even begin to describe how I feel.

####The Declaration####
The past few months in particular have seen tremendous growth for me and it’s staggering to stop and look back at where I am today and where I was in January. One of the more powerful events in this growth taught me something which I’ve been applying to just about every facet of my life since. It’s a declaration, a mantra if you will. It’s “I’m free to move on” and when I first declared it to the Universe, it meant one thing, But now I’ve lost count how many different areas I’ve applied it to. It’s empowering to declare this to the world and feel it in my heart. 

I’m free to move on from my failed marriage.  
I’m free to move on from the shame.  
I’m free to move on from the fear.  
I’m free to move on from the bad choices I’ve made.  
I’m free to move on from the voices from my past that try to keep me chained down.  
I’m free to move on from the sadness and find happiness.  

Navigating this free space as I move away from my past and live in the present is where I find myself today. The voices of my past don’t talk as loudly as before. It’s silent here. For once I can hear myself talk, listen to my intuition, and open up my heart for dialogue and connection.

However, it’s scary living here. I don’t know what lies in front of me tomorrow, next week, or next year. So instead, I focus on today and the moment I’m in right now. 

But I know this fear I feel is a good emotion to experience. If I wasn’t scared, I’d be hiding from my truth. I’m done hiding. I’m done living in fear of my past. The fear I experience now is the fear of uncertainty. Of not having a plan and the next month or years mapped out. Because there’s no path for me to follow. 

It’s scary to keep walking forward when I don’t have a map or any clue where I’m going. But when my mind gets quiet and I can listen to my heart, it tells me to keep walking. It has my back. It rests in the confidence that I’ll get to where I’m supposed to go as long as I keep moving forward with vitality. 

####Listening to My Heart####
The growth has been slow and I’ve grown impatient at times. That is, until I tune into my heart and it tells me all the wisdom I need to hear. It knows things. Things I can’t explain. It’s the part of me that innately knows this is the path I’m supposed to be walking right now. And when I listen to my heart, I’m filled with the confidence and enthusiasm to walk this uncertain and shadowy path knowing I’ll get to where I’m supposed to go. 

It’s not been easy to tune out the voices that have been talking to me for so long and influencing my decisions, but the more I do, the more I reconnect to the powerful spirit that resides in this body and soul which can walk this earth with integrity, truth, wisdom, determination and peace. Only from this place can I truly be free to move on to where I’m supposed to go next.

####The Dark Forest####
It’s time. It’s time for my truth to be revealed to the world. It’s time to stop hiding. It’s time for me to move on. It’s time for me to become who I was meant to be. It’s time to stop letting the shadows speak for me. 

It’s time.  
It’s time.  
It. Is. Time.  

For so long, I’ve been walking along aimlessly in a dark forest. This forest is filled with fear, insecurity and shadows. Over the past 15 months, I’ve caught glimpses of light, that signaled an end may be near. But they all turned out to be false. Discovering I was wrong only led to the darkness and shadows deepening. 

But now, I see light. I see an ocean. I see sunlight. And I’m walking towards it all. I can put my focus and attention on the light and let it be my guide. Following the light will get me out of this dark forest that has practically swallowed me.

This time it feels different.  
This time the light I see is not false and I won’t be let down.  
This time, the light sees me too.
