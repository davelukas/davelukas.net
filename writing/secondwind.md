#Second Wind#
I recently finished _In the Body of the World_ by Eve Ensler (a memoir about her journey through cancer) and the ending had deep resonance within me. It ended on such a high note and with a wonderful metaphor I'm using to define where I'm at in my life right now. The simple task of putting a label on this particular part of my life has renewed it with purpose and meaning. This chapter of my life now has a title and that gives me comfort.

With the divorce behind me, and living by myself **for the first time in my entire life**, I'm navigating unfamiliar territory. Right now, I'm not scared, I'm excited. Though I will confess to being lonely at times not having anyone to talk to about life.

Where this all ties back to Eve's book is simply trusting in the process and unfolding of my life. I'm taking each day on its own and trying not to look too far down the road at next week and next month. Trusting I'm going to get to where I need to go, but acknowledging I need to do my part, show up, do the work and be intentional about the direction I want my life to go. All while remaining open to the plentiful opportunities for life to change course and for magic to show up in my life in a way I would have never suspected.

What I've titled this chapter of my life is what Eve called "second wind". The instant I read it, I resonated and seized the word as my catch-all term for my life right now.
> "We are the people of the second wind. We, who have been undermined, reduced, and minimized, we know who we are. Let us be taken. Let us turn our pain to power, our victimhood to fire, our self-hatred to action, our self-obsession to service, to fire, to wind. Wind. Wind. Be transparent as wind, be as possible and relentless and dangerous, be what moves things forward without needing to leave a mark, be part of this collection of molecules that begins somewhere unknown and can't help but keep rising. Rising. Rising. Rising."

WOW.  
Truth.  

I aspire to continue to rise while allowing myself to be taken. It's a balance of deliberate action and yielding. Of pushing the path along and releasing control.

I haven't the foggiest idea how my life is going to unfold and I'm trying to rest in this uncertainty. Some days, it's difficult. Like today as I write these words, I want my path to be perfectly illuminated and I want someone with me to hold my hand. Not to help me walk, but to simply be with one another and be a witness to our respective journeys. Interdependent not co-dependent. But I can't manifest a partner any more than I can make you read and share my work.

It all distills back to surrender and trust. Surrendering control over my path. Trusting that if I continue to show up every day and do the work, I'll find my way. Surrendering expectations of when that will happen. Trusting in the Universe to guide me to where I'm supposed to go. Surrendering control over when someone shows up in my life. Trusting when I do surrender, she'll appear. Surrendering to the wind to take me. Trusting becoming the second wind will move me forward.

I don't have any answers. I have no idea what I'm doing. Yet my intuition is calm with the knowledge of the wind beginning from somewhere unknown yet going on to become transformative, dangerous and relentless. And I know I will continue to rise. Rise. Rise.
