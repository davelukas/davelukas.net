##One Year Ago

One year ago I watched TV.  
Now I don't have cable in my house.  

One year ago I revolved my Sundays around watching football.
Now I could give two shits about football.  

One year ago I was consumed by and engrossed in fantasy football.  
Now I don't play and I don't miss it whatsoever.  

One year ago I was living with my parents.  
Now I'm living by myself for the first time in my life (minus the times the kids are with me).  

One year ago I was still married.  
Now I'm divorced.  

One year ago I weighed 148 lbs, was too skinny and looked unhealthy.  
Now at 35 years old, I’ve gained weight and I’m the healthiest, strongest and fittest I've been in my entire life.  

One year ago the idea of publishing a book was out of reach.  
Now I've published [two books](http://www.amazon.com/Dave-Lukas/e/B00EUSNW5S/).  

One year ago I had no idea how to code or program or what git, node, VPS or repos were.  
Now I've built this site using those tools.  

One year ago I had a very small circle of friends.  
Now that circle has expanded further than I could have imagined.  

One year ago the idea of a meditation practice was just something I wanted to do, but never did.  
Now I've meditated every day since March 1, 2013.  

One year ago the thought of facing my shadows induced fear.  
Now I’ve learned about my shadows and embody them daily.  

One year ago I believed I was unlovable.  
Now I know with all my heart I'm worthy and deserving of love.

A lot can change over the course of a year. What changes will you start to make today which you can look back on next year with pride?

I'm not going to sugarcoat it and say growth is easy work cause it's not, but it's time to show up in your life and do the work. No one is going to do it for you cause nobody else gives a shit like you do.

So what's it going to be? Sit on the sidelines or get in the game? Cause I'm going to keep playing. Will you join me?
