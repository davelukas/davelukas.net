###Only Sky###
the plane pierces through the clouds.  
enters a new world.  
where the ground is wooly,  
and above, only sky.  

the sun is also rising.  
my eyes seek out its’ illumination.  
welcoming me.  
into the world in the clouds.  

the skyline of chicago,  
resides in this world today.  
given special permission,  
to be uprooted,  
and live in clouds for a spell.  

peaceful and serene,  
the city looks,  
resting among the clouds,  
with no unpleasant linear streets,  
and dull colors of gray.  

instead, it’s just the buildings,  
who always reach for the sky.  
and now they’ve found it.  
entered this new world,  
of clouds, sky and sun,  
if only for a short time.  
it finds the same tranquility,  
that lodges in my heart,  
to be among the sky again.  


###Ocean Friend###
i run towards the ocean,  
the magnitude of her presence,  
pulls me,  
acts as my compass.  

the sight of her always makes me smile.  
i find a spot in the sand,  
sit down, and greet my old friend.  

all five senses,  
become activated,  
which triggers,  
me to stillness.  

the ocean is tranquil.  
an absence of significant waves.  
in the months i’ve visited,  
this is the calmest my friend has been.  

a spark of insight,  
illuminates in my mind.  
i am also tranquil,  
in a way i haven’t been for some time.  

this realization,  
the connecting of the dots,  
between my tranquility,  
and my ocean friend,  
makes me smile.  
my intuition beams,  
and the setting sun seems to wink in my direction.  

i close my eyes.  
breathe deeply.  
and the ocean begins to speak to me,  

“you have arrived.  
we welcome you now.  
in your calm state,  
we see you,  
acknowledge the work you’ve done.  
we see you.  

“we were here when times were tough.  
we mirrored your anger,  
your fear,  
your shame,  
your loneliness,  
with our tumultuous waves,  
we were with you.  

“and we are with you now.  
we reflect what we see in you.  
peace,  
tranquility.”  

and with the setting sun,  
the extinguishing of the light of the day.  
i acknowledge,  
my light does not fade away,  
it remains inside,  
shining out for all to see.  

but today it shines brighter,  
because i’m with my ocean friend,  
and we are a witness to each other,  
and the peace that resides within our hearts.
