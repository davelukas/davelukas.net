# Want to feel like a badass?
Learn to code! _I can help._

# Rather not learn to code?
That's cool. I can help with that too.

The good news about the laboratory I'm running here is I can mix and match any combination of teaching and action taking you're looking for. We can find the right balance between full service tech help and complete self-education.

# What do I offer?
	- Full service website support: buy your domain name, set up your website, build it, hand you the keys
	- Training on how to:
		- buy a domain name
		- set up a mailing list
		- learn coding
		- get off WordPress and build your own site
	- Content strategy coaching. What to write, how to write it, how to bring in customers.
	- Review and give feedback on what a client is already doing and offering

# Why work with me?
	- I've been building websites since the late 90s where my first website was a Star Wars fan site complete with wav files and animated gif lightsabers.
	- I've seen the evolution of the web and how best to acheive the results you're looking for.
