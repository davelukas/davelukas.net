**So...what's up?**  
You tell me, you're the one who clicked on my about page. Ask me a question.

**What are you working on?**  
Right now I'm in the lab working on a lot of stuff. Rolling out some tech services to help people get up to speed with various things on the internet: websites, mailing lists, etc. But also offering some services to people who want to learn this shit themselves.

**Why would I want to learn this myself? Can't I just pay someone to do it?**  
Sure, you could pay someone to do it, but where's the fun in that?! It's tremendously empowering to build a site from scratch or write some code, push it to your site and see it live! I feel like a badass when I do it!

**What else do I need to know about you?**  
I'm a divorced Dad of two: an 8 year old son and 6 year old daughter.

I'm a runner. I've run everything from a 5k to a 50 mile race.

**Wait, hold up there champ. Did you say 50 miles?!**  
Yes I did! I ran a 50 mile race!

**Are you crazy?**  
Yep!
