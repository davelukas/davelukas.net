**So...what's up?**  
You tell me, you're the one who clicked on my about page. Ask me a question.

**What are you working on?**  
Right now...I'm not sure. The work involves this site as I continue to build it and tweak it. It seems as soon as I start, I fall further down the rabbit hole of changes I'd like to make.

**That was a shitty answer!**  
I know it was, let me finish. I published two books on Amazon (found [here](http://amzn.com/B00FND4X0C) and [here](http://amzn.com/B00ESPNUIM)) in the month of September and I decided to take the month of October off to rest and celebrate what I had accomplished.

But that break has now extended into November and I'm still at a loss on what my next project is.

**So when are you going to figure that out?**  
You're filled with good questions! I don't know yet. There's a line between resting and putting your butt in chair and lately I feel I need to be in the "put your butt in the chair" camp. Yet I'm not clear what it is I'll be working on.

**Do you have any idea what that might be?**  
It certainly involves writing cause I feel called to do that, but proramming and development is where I see my work going.

Shit is changing on the web and I'd like to be near the front of that parade.

**What else do I need to know about you?**  
I'm a divorced Dad of two: an 8 year old son and 5 year old daughter.

I'm a runner. I've run everything from a 5k to a 50 mile race.

**Wait, hold up there champ. Did you say 50 miles?!**  
Yes I did! I ran a 50 mile race!

**Are you crazy?**  
Yep!
