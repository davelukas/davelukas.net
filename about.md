So you want to know who Dave Lukas is huh? I'm not sure what I should put here cause I don't feel like telling my life story. Not to mention that my life is evolving faster than I'd care to update this page.

So let's keep things simple:  
  - I'm a divorced Dad of two.  
  - I'm a runner. My focus is on the long distance races right now (i.e. 50k, 50 miles).  
  - I'm a writer.  
  - I'm a poet.  
  - I'm an artist.  
  - I'm a developer cause I built this site myself, with the help of [Gwen Bell](http://gwenbell.com/) and [Ev Bogue](http://evbogue.com/).
