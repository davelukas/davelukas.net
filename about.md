**So...what's up?**  
You tell me, you're the one who clicked on my about page. Ask me a question.

**What are you working on?**  
Right now I'm in the lab working on a lot of stuff. Rolling out some tech services to help people get up to speed with various things on the internet: websites, mailing lists, etc. But also offering some services to people who want to learn this shit themselves.

**Why would I want to learn this myself? Can't I just pay someone to do it?**  
Sure, you could pay someone to do it, but where's the fun in that?! It's tremendously empowering to build a site from scratch or write some code, push it to your site and see it live! I feel like a badass when I do it!

**What else do I need to know about you?**  
I'm a poet. If you're interested in reading some of my poetry, you can read a small sample [here](/poetry) or you can check out my poetry book on [Amazon](http://amzn.com/B00FND4X0C). Or you can [email me](mailto:dave@davelukas.net) and I'll send you the latest poems.

But poetry isn't where "the work" is right now. It used to be, but now the work has evolved, just like life. So if you'd still like to read more, [let me know](mailto:dave@davelukas.net).

**Cool! What else you got?!**  
I'm a divorced Dad of two: an 8 year old son and 6 year old daughter.

I'm a runner. I've run everything from a 5k to a 50 mile race.

**Wait, hold up there champ. Did you say 50 miles?!**  
Yes I did! I ran a 50 mile race!

**Are you crazy?**  
Yep!

**.....**  
[Email me](mailto:dave@davelukas.net) if you have any more questions.
