So you want to know my story huh? I'm not sure what I should put here cause I don't feel like telling my life story. Not to mention that my life is evolving faster than I'd care to update this page.

So let's keep things simple:  
  - I'm a [divorced](http://davelukas.net/writing#itstime) Dad of two kids (aged 8 and 5).  
  - I'm a runner. My focus is on the long distance races right now (e.g. 50k, 50 miles). If you're interested, I'm the creator of [Runner Hero](http://runnerhero.com), a running website that's beyond amazing!  
  - I'm a [writer](http://davelukas.net/writing).  
  - I'm a [poet](http://davelukas.net/poetry). My first poetry book **_Breaking Free & Releasing Into the Nothing_** can be [purchased here](http://amzn.com/B00FND4X0C).  
  - I'm an artist.  
  - I'm a developer cause I built this site myself, with the help of [Gwen Bell](http://gwenbell.com/) and [Ev Bogue](http://evbogue.com/).
